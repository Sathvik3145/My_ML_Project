The ASD Prediction System is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the likelihood of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in individuals based on behavioral and demographic data. The system leverages various classification algorithms—including Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost (XGB)—to analyze patterns and provide accurate predictions.

The primary goal of this project is to support early detection and awareness of ASD by utilizing data-driven insights. Among the models tested, the Support Vector Classifier demonstrated the highest performance in terms of accuracy and generalization.

This project emphasizes the practical application of ML techniques in the healthcare domain, specifically in early screening tools that can assist professionals and caregivers in making informed decisions.
